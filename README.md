# Zipffy #
Zipffy will display Zipf's Law when given any text file.

Zipf's law states that given a large sample of words used, the frequency of any
word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. So word
number N has a frequency of 1/N.

Thus the most frequent word will occur about twice as often as the second most
frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc
